        <h3> About me: </h3> 
     
         Hey there, This Ahmed Mamdouh, I was in hospitality career then,
         In quarantine,
         I decided to switch my career to be a software engineer
         so I started my self-learning journey to learn software fundamentals.
         I was in a discovery journey learning things that doesn’t help me to gain knowledge to make me qualified
         so I decided to start my career with ITI, Information Technology Institute,
         to continue my fundamental’s step and up to advanced degree at software development.
